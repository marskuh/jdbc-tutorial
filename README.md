# JDBC Tutorial

This repository is dedicated to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/javahelp">r/javahelp</a> and hopefully enables people to get Database communication with Java set up more quickly.

## How to get started

To get started, check out this repository and then load the `intellij` directory with the IntelliJ IDE.
